# AB Tests

### Test 1
- **Different Background Colors**
- **US1**
- **Metrics:** Retention and Net Promoter Score
- **Hypothesis:** We are trying to find out which UI choices would make users more likely to use the app more. While this problem does not seem relevant to our users, it is very relevant to us: the developers who want people to use their app as much as possible. **If users are exposed to darker colors, they are more likely to use the app because darker colors are more soothing**
- **Experiment:** Since our app has a uniform background color, we will modify the color that is displayed.
- **Variants:** There are two main variants, a lighter purple and a darker purple
