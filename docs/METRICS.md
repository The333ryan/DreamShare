# Net Promoter Score
-Users are initially directed to the authorization page. Upon logging in, a backend system tracks and increments their login count. Next, users are taken to the Dreamlist page, where an action pop-up featuring the NPS 
survey appears. This pop-up is presented periodically, such as every 20 to 30 logins.

The NPS survey features various questions, including: "How likely are you to recommend the app to a friend?" and "Do you have any issues or suggestions to enhance your experience?"
