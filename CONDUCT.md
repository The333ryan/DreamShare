# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Our code of conduct emphasizes professionalism, collaboration, responsibility, 
ethics, and well-being. Team members should treat each other with respect, 
communicate openly, and support one another in achieving our goals. Everyone 
is accountable for their actions and should strive to produce high-quality 
work while maintaining confidentiality and fairness. We also value work-life
balance and mental well-being, encouraging practices that promote a healthy

## Warnings

If a group member is not contributing equally to the project, it is the responsibility 
of the other group members to notify that individual. They must hold the member 
accountable for completing the tasks assigned by the Scrum Master.
